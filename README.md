# PyTTT

## Introduction

This is a modularized, functor-based, dependency injection architected, arbitrarily configurable, 3d tic-tac-toe implementation.

`utils.py` contains the implementation of various functors for victory conditions and is largely used by `main.py` to determine how games should be determined to end.

It supports arbitrary piece placements, game mechanics, and even offers a puzzle-based version.
